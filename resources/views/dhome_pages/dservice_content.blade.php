                    <p><strong>It’s no secret: The cost of fuel is on the rise. Unmonitored trucking fleets can lead to
                            inefficient fuel consumption, which wastes this valuable resource and increases operating
                            expenses. Additionally, poor driving habits and inefficient routes can increase your fuel
                            use
                            and lead to premature equipment failure.<br/>
                            Darpan's GPS tracking software addresses these issues head on and in real time. As
                            an added benefit, fleet tracking systems enable supervisors to improve routing and reduce
                            idle
                            times, further improving fuel efficiency.</strong></p>
